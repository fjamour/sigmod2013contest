test.cpp has been modified to enable encrypting the last document.
you should firt modify the test data with gen_hack.cpp

gen_hack fname `tail -1 fname | grep cut -f2 -d' '`
mv res_sol.txt fname_new

then
testdriver fname `tail -1 fname | grep cut -f2 -d' '`




================

test_through.cpp has the throughput calculation version of testdriver (with no last line encryption)
