Scripts that run on the web server machine and the evaluation server.

The configuration scripts/information required for each script are described.


Scripts should store logs of everything done in a log file.
Scripts should read parameters from file/user parameters


NOTES:
1. It's assumed that no two submissions will ever have the same timestamp (no two submissions in the same second)
   this should be implemented in the PHP side
