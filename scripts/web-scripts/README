Scripts here are responsible for getting the submissions from whereever Apache
stores them, copies them to evaluation machine and waits for results.

1. the script looks for new submissions based on timestamps
2. copies any new submission to the evaluation server
3. pulls what ever new results available on the evaluation machine
4. updates the submissions table with the results pulled from evaluation
   machine database




STEPS:
1. do: (to get passwordless access to the evaluation machine which is needed for push-submissions-1.py) 
>ssh-keygen
>ssh-copy-id fuad@10.126.144.130
>ssh-add (if necessary)


TODOs:
1. notify by email if errors happen
2. write errors to a log file (or may be simply direct stdout to a log file?)
