ACM SIGMOD 2013 Programming Contest Submission System

In this file you'll find useful information on how the submission system works, 
and what to modify to customize it.

-                  Overview                  -
----------------------------------------------
There are scripts to be run on a web server, an evaluation server (the machine that will run the submissions), 
and a backup server. I was using my own machine as a backup server.

Your machine must have passwordless ssh access to both the web server and the evaluation server.
The web server must have passwordless ssh to the evaluation server, and access to a mysql database
on the evaluation server. The evaluation server is assumed not to have access to any machine, 
in our setup that was the case to make sure that if a submission messes up, only the evaluation server
is affected and no other machine in our network is affected. Worst thing is evaluation server
goes down and we reflash it.

To set up a machine to be a web server do the following:
(assume WEB_IP is the ip address of the web server)
1. ssh-copy-id USERNAME@WEB_IP
(your machine must have passwordless access to the web server for the auto deployment scripts to work)
2. go to scripts/deployment-scripts-2014/init-params.sh and modify the parameters 
3. change directory to scripts/deployment-scripts-2014 and run 'bash start-web-1.sh'
(this will copy all the web server scripts, do proper permission changes and run the scripts)

To set up a machine to be an evaluation server do the same steps for the web server but run 
'bash start-eval-1.sh' instead.
